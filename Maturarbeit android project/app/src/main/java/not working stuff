- spawn points (different teams should spawn in different corners)
- when game is finished, you should be able to restart or end
- parent of gameClient activity should be StartActivity
- particleShotEvent not working
- bitmap of SlimeTrail should be scaled to radius
- slime should move faster on slime, not slower
- game crashes when client tries to pick up LightBulb
- you can get bigger in illegal locations
- invisible ghost bitmap is somehow not sharp, it gets smoothened

btw my comments are like this
// blabla
beginning with a space and a small letter except when the first word is a class name or similar
